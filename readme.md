### Background

I wanted a quick way to visualize data stored in a simple text file. I initially created some scripts in R that generated graphs but this was a two step process of creating the graph and then opening the generated graph.

After seeing [command-line sparklines](https://github.com/holman/spark) I figured I could do the same thing using block characters for bar charts.
